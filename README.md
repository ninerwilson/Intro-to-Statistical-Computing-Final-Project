# Intro-to-Statistical-Computing-Final-Project
This is a group project I collaborated on as the finale to my introductory course in R. We worked with an Airbnb data set. I was responsible from some of the writing, and coding the B group of questions.

It was a fun experience, not only because I enjoyed getting my hands on a 'real' data set, but also because I learned a lot from my groupmates. It was eye-opening to learn how they understood the data and see how they wanted to play with it to get better insights into our leading questions.
